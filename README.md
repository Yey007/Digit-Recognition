# Digit-Recognition
Hello!

I started this project with the aim of getting into neural networks, but now that I've "finished", it's evident I bit off a bit more
than I could chew. Basically, this project wasn't that successful. I haven't been able to get it to actually learn to recognize multiple
different digits. It's pretty good at recognizing just one digit if you feed it just that and test it later. Anyways, that's about all it
can do. You're free to download the repo and play around with it, but if you want to make somehing like this you should probably just
startfrom scratch. 

Thanks for reading.
